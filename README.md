## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=2.19.6)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Android device or emulator

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fin-track
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Android Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- `READ_SMS` - To read bank transaction SMS messages
- `RECEIVE_SMS` - To receive new SMS messages
- `READ_PHONE_STATE` - To access phone state information

These permissions are declared in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer**: UI components, pages, widgets, and BLoCs
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, entities, and use cases
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, data sources, and models

### State Management

Uses **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern for:

- Reactive state management
- Separation of business logic from UI
- Testable code structure
- Event-driven architecture

## SMS Processing

The app includes sophisticated SMS parsing to extract transaction data from various bank formats:

### Supported Banks

- State Bank of India (SBI)
- HDFC Bank
- ICICI Bank
- Axis Bank
- (More banks can be added via SMS patterns)

### Transaction Extraction

- Amount parsing with currency symbols
- Date and time extraction
- Merchant/vendor identification
- Account number masking
- Transaction type detection (debit/credit)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Code Generation

```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

### Building for Release

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Follow Dart/Flutter conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Write tests for new features

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally on the device
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- **Permission Transparency**: Clear explanation of why permissions are needed
- **No External APIs**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Open Source**: Code is open for security audits
