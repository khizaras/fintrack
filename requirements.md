## Title: Flutter Mobile App for Automatic SMS Transaction Tracking

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Flutter mobile application that automatically reads SMS messages from banks and financial institutions to track user expenses and income. The app will categorize transactions, provide insights into spending habits, and allow users to set budgets.

## Objectives

1. Develop a user-friendly mobile application using Flutter.
2. Implement SMS reading functionality to extract transaction data from bank and financial institution messages.
3. Categorize transactions into predefined categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment).
4. Provide insights into user spending habits through visualizations and reports.
5. Allow users to set and manage budgets for different spending categories.
6. Ensure data privacy and security by implementing necessary permissions and encryption.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Users can create an account or log in using existing credentials.
- Support for social media login options (e.g., Google, Facebook).

### 2. SMS Reading and Transaction Extraction

- Request necessary permissions to read SMS messages.
- Automatically read and parse SMS messages from banks and financial institutions and extract relevant transaction data.
- Handle different SMS formats from various banks.
- store transaction data in a secure local database where it can be accessed for categorization and analysis and can be exported if needed.

### 3. Transaction Categorization

- Automatically categorize transactions into predefined categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment).
- Allow users to create custom categories and assign transactions to them.
- Provide an option for users to manually categorize transactions if automatic categorization is incorrect.

### 4. Spending Insights and Reports

- Generate visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) to show spending habits over
  different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Provide insights into spending patterns, highlighting areas of high expenditure.
- Allow users to filter reports by categories, time periods, and transaction types (income/expense).

### 5. Budget Management

- Allow users to set budgets for different categories.
- Notify users when they approach or exceed their budget limits.
- Provide a summary of budget performance, showing how much has been spent versus the budgeted amount.

### 6. Data Privacy and Security

- Implement necessary permissions and encryption to ensure user data is protected.
- Provide users with clear information about data usage and storage.
- Allow users to delete their data and account if desired.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Platform

- The app will be developed using Flutter to ensure cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).

### 2. SMS Reading

- Use the `sms` package or similar to read SMS messages.
- Implement background services to continuously monitor incoming SMS messages.

### 3. Database

- Use SQLite or a similar local database to store transaction data securely.
- Implement data encryption to protect sensitive information.

### 4. User Interface

- Design a clean, professional, rich looking, spectacular, and intuitive user interface using Flutter's Material Design components.
- Ensure the app is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

### 5. Testing

- Conduct unit testing for individual components.
- Perform integration testing to ensure all features work together seamlessly.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a group of beta testers to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
